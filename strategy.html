            <p class="blog-post-meta">July 10, 2022 by <a href="/Statistics/about.html">Shailza Sharma</a></p>

            <p>This blog will cover the tips and tricks that you need to follow in order to efficiently practice the previous year exams.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>1. Keep aside the last 3 year exams!</h3>
            <p>The first step is to keep aside the last 3 year exams so that you can practice your exam in real time by actually giving the exam with real papers after you are completely done with your prep.</p>
        <p>You need to do this because even though there might be some mocks on google but you will never be able to really check your real progress until you give the exam in real-time. This will actually familiarize with the pressure that one feels during the final exam. So just keep them aside and never ever open these until you feel like you are ready to give the final exam!</p>
            
        <h3> 2. Donot look at the solutions immediately!</h3>
        <p>I know it seems very tempting to just look at the solutions immediately and then solve the question, but you need to stop doing this because the number of real resources are very few incase of JAM MS. So, even if you are unable to solve the question in one go, don't worry about it. Move ahead, and just keep that question inside your head, the solution will come to you eventually. </p>
        <p>What this will do is that, now whenever you will see any new question that might be of this type you will already know how to solve it because your mind had already worked really hard for finding the solution.</p>
        <p>What if you don't get the solution ? Then look at the solution but make sure that you mark that question and revise that question many many times. Make your brain pay for looking at the solution!</p>

        <h3> 3. After completing a specific topic, immediately practice the questions from that topic </h3>
        <p> It's very important to practice the questions immediately from a certain topic. 
            For e.g. take any random exam, find out the questions from that topic in the exam and then start to solve them. Don't worry if you can't solve them all, atleast you are getting an idea of what questions will there be in the exam.
        </p>
        
        <h4> 4. Start to keep track of your time </h4>
        <p>Start doing this for exams from 2016 onwards. Try to solve these exams within 3 hours. This will start to give you an idea of time management.  Ofcourse, you should not just jump right onto doing this. Start with 2005 exam and then when you reach the 2016 exam start to give more attention towards time management.</p>

        <h4> 5. Keep track of your mistakes!</h4>
        <p>My biggest problem was that I would make really silly mistakes in the calculations. So you need to be really mindful of the mistakes that you often do. If you make silly mistakes during the calculations, make a habit of solving the question twice  or atleast thouroughly check the solution.
            Now you might think that we have so less time, how can we solve a question twice, but it's very much achievable. Once you get in the habit of doing so, in the final exam it becomes really easy.
            You should know that NAT is one of the easiest and at the same time, toughest sections to get marks. So it will all boil down to the fact whether or not your calculations were correct.
        </p>

        <h5> 6. Practice Practice Practice!</h5>
        <p> You need to understand the fact that practicising a question paper is extremely important. Once you are done with the entire syllabus, each and every day practice atleast one exam. It will hardly take you one hour everyday(for 2005-2013 exams), so just try and practice as much as possible. 
            This is the most crucial part of any exam prep, you should make yourself as confortable with exam as possible.
